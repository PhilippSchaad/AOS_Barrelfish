\chapter{ClownFish}\label{c:clownfish}

Throughout this project we have tried to keep most of our individual subsystems 
and libraries as simple as possible. This is to support the mentality that our 
code should be easy to understand (well ok that didn't always work) and easy to 
debug and reason about. Keeping things like data structures simple, easy to 
understand, and general purpose sometimes comes at a cost of performance. We 
have decided that potential performance gains achieved by over-complicating our 
system and book-keeping mechanisms would be negligible compared to the 
additional cost in complexity.
